## Getting Started

Fortunately, the installation process of `atm` is relatively simple
and can be achieved by your average linux user.

However, some prerequisites are required.

### Prerequisites

- Python `3.x`
- Pip Package Manager
- Archcraft OS


### Installation

Now that you've got your prerequisites! 

Go ahead and run the following commands to install `atm`.

```bash
git clone https://benjibrown/atm.git
cd atm
pip3 install -r requirements.t
```

## Usage

The usage of this tool is fairly self-explantory however, I'll give you a quick overview of it now.

### Option `-i`

This option displays the information for a given theme if it is present in the `themes.json` file. If not, you will be alerted by the tool.

It prints a range of information from the window managers to a short description to a basic color scheme.

### Option `-d`

This option downloads and installs the supplied theme as long as it is found in the `themes.json` file. 

Firstly, it downloads the theme and extracts it. From here it runs the `install.sh` script inside that archive (supplied by the theme creator). Finally, once the installation proccess has finished, theme is applied and the leftovers are cleaned up.
